\contribution{We demonstrate the benefits of using Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize High Power Laser systems over currently dominant approaches based on gradient-free optimization.}
{Prior works on laser optimization focused on black-box optimization techniques which assume stationarity, require costly real-world function evaluations, and can endanger the system at test-time.}

\contribution{We learn a control policy directly from images, which are made available via widespread diagnostics devices.}
{Instead of relying on noisy and lengthy processes to obtain structured representations of the system's state, we leverage unstructured observations coming from diagnostic devices as inputs for the control policy.}

\contribution{We train control policies entirely in simulation and successfully transfer them across unknown, varying dynamics, showing robustness to different parametrizations.}
{Transferring policies is hindered by the discrepancies across different domains, and Domain Randomization, a promising technique widely explored in then field of robot learing, can be leveraged to ensure robustness.}
