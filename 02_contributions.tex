\contribution{We demonstrate the full benefits of using Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize High Power Laser systems over currently dominant approaches based on gradient-free optimization.}
{Prior works on laser optimization focused on black-box optimization techniques which assume stationarity, require costly real-world function evaluations, and can endanger the system at test-time.}

\contribution{We learn a control policy directly from images, which are made available via widespread diagnostics devices.}
{Instead of relying on noisy and lengthy processes to obtain structured representations of the system's state, we leverage unstructured observations coming from diagnostic devices as inputs for the control policy.}

\contribution{We train and evaluate control policies across a range of simulated dynamics, providing preliminary evidence of performance retention under varying environment parametrizations.}
{Domain Randomization during training ensures robust performance across varied test environments, paving the way towards real-world use in under-modeled, non-stationary conditions.}
