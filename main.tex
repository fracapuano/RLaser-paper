% Enter the title of your paper:
\title{Shaping Laser Pulses with Reinforcement Learning}

% The "running title" will be displayed in the header on every-other page.
% It is typically either the same as the title or a shorter version of the title.
% Enter your running title here:
\setrunningtitle{Shaping Laser Pulses with Reinforcement Learning}

% WARNING: Authors must not appear in the submitted version. They should be hidden
% as long as the rlj package is used without the [accepted] or [preprint] options.
% Non-anonymous submissions will be rejected without review.

% Enter the author names below. 
% NOTE: Denote affiliations using superscripts as in the provided example.
% NOTE: Use \textscript{1,2,3} instead of $^{1,2,3}$.
%       - Failure to do so will cause affiliation superscripts to appear on the cover page for camera-ready and preprint versions.
\author{
Francesco Capuano\textsuperscript{1},
Davorin Peceli\textsuperscript{2},
Gabriele Tiboni\textsuperscript{3,4}
}

% NOTE: For camera-ready and preprint versions, the cover page includes author names but not affiliations.
% It automatically removes the superscripts for affiliations.
% If the automatic process breaks (e.g., if an author name should include a superscript), you can manually define the author string to appear on the cover page by uncommenting the following line.
%\coverPageAuthor{Marlos C. Machado, Philip S. Thomas, Lorem Ipsum}

% Author emails, which can be clustered if they have shared endings as in this example
\emails{
francesco.capuano@ens-paris-saclay.fr, \\
davorin.peceli@eli-beams.eu, \\
gabriele.tiboni@uni-wuerzburg.de
}

% Author affiliations, in the order the occur
% The inclusion of state/province, etc. is optional.
% The inclusion of multiple affiliations is optional.
%   - List multiple affiliations with comma-separated numbers as in the example.
\affiliations{
$^{1}$\textbf{École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France} \\
$^{2}$\textbf{Extreme Light Infrastructure-ELI Beamlines, ELI Beamlines, Dolní Břežany, Czechia }\\
$^{3}$\textbf{Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany}\\
$^{4}$\textbf{Technische Universität Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany}
}

% Include a list of keywords for the topic of the paper:
\keywords{Applied RL, DRL for Science, Sim-to-real, Domain Randomization, Ultra-short pulses}

% Define the summary that appears on the cover page.
