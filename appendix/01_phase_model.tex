NOT SURE IF KEEPING AS IT LOOKS A BIT TO PHYSICSY, PERHAPS IN APPENDIX $I_t = \frac{2E}{\pi \omega_0^2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \chi(\psi_t) du}$, with $\chi(\psi)$ representing the temporal profile corresponding to the control $\psi$, $E$ being the energy of the pulse and $\omega_0$ being the pulse central angular frequency.
